Hi, welcome to my blog!

My name is Jiechang Guo. 

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences from Jiaxing University, China, in 2015.

Then, in 2018 I got my master's degree in Digital Media Technology from Hangzhou Dianzi University, China.

Later I worked at Arcsoft in Hangzhou for three years as a Computer Graphics Engineer.

Currently, I live in Houston, TX. I'm pursuing my second master's degree at the University of Houston and working in Computer Graphics and Interactive Media Lab [CGIM](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu)

I'm interested in the techniques related to Computer Graphics, including character animation, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.

In my blog, I will post some demo videos of my past projects, take some notes about my Leetcode process, share some techniques etc.

I used to maintain a CSDN blog which is in Chinese [my CSDN blog](https://blog.csdn.net/u011310341)
