Hi, welcome to my blog!

My name is Jiechang Guo. 

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jiaxing University, China, in 2015.

Then, in 2018 I got my master's degree in Digital Media Technology from Hangzhou Dianzi University, China.

Later I worked at Arcsoft in Hangzhou for three years as a Computer Graphics Engineer.

Currently, I live in Houston, TX. I'm pursuing my second master's degree at the University of Houston.

I'm interested in the techniques related to Computer Graphics, including character animation, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.

In my blog, I will post some demo videos of my past projects, take some notes about my Leetcode process, share some techniques etc.
