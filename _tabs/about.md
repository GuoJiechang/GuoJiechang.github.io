Hi, welcome to my blog!

My name is Jiechang Guo. 

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences from Jiaxing University,China, in 2015.

Then, in 2018 I got my master's degree in Digital Media from Hangzhou Dianzi University, China.

Later I worked at Arcsoft in Hangzhou for three years as a Computer Graphics Engineer.

Currently, I live in Houston, TX. I'll study the M.S.C.S at the University of Houston this fall semester.

I'm interested in the techniques related to Computer Graphics, like character animation, virtual reality, and augmented reality, etc.

In my blog, I will post some demo videos of my past projects, take some notes about my leetcode process, share some technique etc.

I used to maintain a CSDN blog which is in Chinese [my csdn blog](https://blog.csdn.net/u011310341)
